#  all this does is prevent the init.d script from printing a message

# This file is used instead of the default /etc/rsyncd.conf
# Warning: This option has no effect if the daemon is accessed
#          using a remote shell. When using a different file for
#          rsync you might want to symlink /etc/rsyncd.conf to
#          that file.

# what extra options to give rsync --daemon?
#  that excludes the --daemon; that's always done in the init.d script
#  Possibilities are:
#   --address=123.45.67.89              (bind to a specific IP address)
#   --port=8730                         (bind to specified port; default 873)

# run rsyncd at a nice level?
#  the rsync daemon can impact performance due to much I/O and CPU usage,
#  so you may want to run it at a nicer priority than the default priority.
#  Allowed values are 0 - 19 inclusive; 10 is a reasonable value.

# run rsyncd with ionice?
#  "ionice" does for IO load what "nice" does for CPU load.
#  As rsync is often used for backups which aren't all that time-critical,
#  reducing the rsync IO priority will benefit the rest of the system.
#  See the manpage for ionice for allowed options.
#  -c3 is recommended, this will run rsync IO at "idle" priority. Uncomment
#  the next line to activate this.
